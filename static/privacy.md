# Privacy Policy

This project is just a hobby project of mine. I made it to help myself build
good habits. I will be happy if it helps you too.

## Information this website collects

First of all, all your "Streaks" are stored in Google's drive, using Google's API. 
I'm as a developer of [streak.anvaka.com](https://streak.anvaka.com) have no access
to your files or streaks.

The only thing that this website records is your Google User Id. Google User Id is 
publicly available, and generally is not a secret.

Why am I collecting user id? This is done to let users share their public streaks with
the world. I have no intent to use this information for any other reason.

Also this website uses [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/#/),
to help me understand where the traffic comes from. No other information is recorded here.

## Information security

The information exchange happens strictly over secure https protocol. The user ids
are stored in [Google's Datastore](https://cloud.google.com/datastore/docs/concepts/overview).

## Your feedback

As I mentioned above, this is just a hobby of mine. If you find something missing in
this privacy policy or would like to have something fixed - [please let me know](https://github.com/anvaka/streak/issues).
